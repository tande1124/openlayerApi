The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\r\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\r\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\r\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\r\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\r\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\r\n *\r\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\r\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\r\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\r\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\r\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\r\n * would return the new center.\r\n *\r\n * You can add your own observable properties with\r\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\r\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\r\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\r\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\r\n *\r\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\r\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\r\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\r\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\r\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\r\n *\r\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.
